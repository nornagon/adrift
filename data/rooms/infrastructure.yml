  #    Infrastructure hubs serve a variety of purposes.
  #   Some will have equipment racks for a variety of purposes, including:
  #     life support (incl. temperature regulation, gas balance, etc)
  #     intra-ship communications
  #     power systems management
  # There will also typically be some bulky equipment used for those same
  #   activities, (plumbing, water heating, etc) as well as perhaps emergency power generators
  #   or life support gear and other emergency equipment - fire extinguishers, emergency oxygen tanks, etc.
  #   AAdditionally the infrastructure rooms will contain access hatches to the jeffries tubes.
